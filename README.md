# Water Mod

### A mod for a modding competition

This mod adds:
* Water Pickaxe
* Water Axe
* Water Shovel
* Water Hoe
* Water Sword

They are all crafted with the normal recipes using water buckets as the material. They have the strength of wooden tools. They all have 1 durability.

These tool may seem useless at first glance—they do break very easily after all. But upon closer inspection, we see that these are representative of the human experience.
The lack of durability in these tools is a metaphor for the pain and suffering we go through as humans. They are relatively difficult to craft, requiring lots of iron. This is analogous to the work we do as humans in society to get to where we want to be, sometimes without a reward at the end.
By playing with this mod, you understand the immense thought that went into these items—their textures, their recipes, their uses—so that you remember what they represent as you play Minecraft.
